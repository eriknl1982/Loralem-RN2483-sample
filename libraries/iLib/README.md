iLib
====

Library for sensors and some atmel-specific functions. The following sensors can be used with an uniform interface and come with arduino-examples: 

- Austria Microsystems TCS3772: light sensor - RGB and clear
- Silicon Labs SI7021: humidity sensor
- Invensense MPU9250: 9DOF - 3 axis acceleration and gyro PLUS AK8963-IC with magnetic-field sensor
- Freescale MPL3115A2: pressure
- Maxim MAX44009: ambient and lux with incredible wide dynamic
- NXP PCF2127: Realtime-Clock with 2ppm 
- Bosch BMP280: pressure
- ST L3G-Series: 3 axis gyro / angular rate
- Freescale MAG3110: 3 axis Compass / Magnetic field
- Freescale MMA8451: 3 axis acceleration
